---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Changelog for "More than Capable"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 07/06/2019
	- Complete overhaul, full rewrite.
	- Rewrote all the C# to repeat itself less.
	- Rewrote all the XML/Patches to reflect the changes.
	- Updated Harmony to 1.2.0.2
	- Initial release of "More than Capable" by NotFood.

- 12/08/2018
	- PAC should now once again work just fine in conjunction with Fluffy's "Work
	  Tab" mod.
	  
- 12/05/2018
	- Rewrote XML patches to improve load efficiency slightly.

- 10/14/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld 1.0 release!
	- Pawns who hate violence but have a passion for the Animals skill will no
	  longer display on the work tab as having a passion for hunting.
	  
- 09/29/2018
	- "Force Do Job" behavior, which allows a pawn to be told to do a specific
	  job even if not assigned to the relevant work type, is still the default,
	  but can now be disabled via a new configuration option.
	
- 09/24/2018
	- Attempting to draft pawns such as hacked mechanoids from Roolo's "What the
	  Hack?!" (which lack some of the attributes of colonist pawns) should no
	  longer generate error messages.
	  
- 09/22/2018
	- "Incapable of dumb labor" is now a special case. Pawns who hate dumb labor
	  are given a trait that reduces their carrying capacity and unskilled labor
	  work speed. They can be assigned to hauling or cleaning with only a minor
	  mood penalty, which will *not* increase over time.
	- Pawns who hate plant work or skilled labor but are assigned to cut plants
	  are handled similarly, with a simple static mood penalty as opposed to a
	  scaling penalty.
	- Plant cutting is now consistently treated, as it is in vanilla, as skilled
	  labor rather than dumb labor.
	- Updated the version of the Harmony library the mod uses.

- 09/15/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld b19 release.
	- Removed "Mod Sync Ninja" files.

- 12/04/2017
	- The mod now works with the "Mod Sync Ninja" updater.
	
- 12/03/2017
	- Made a slight fix to one of the fixes. That's necessary sometimes. :)

- 12/03/2017
	- BUG FIX: All "dumb labor" and "skilled labor" jobs will be appropriately
 	  flagged on the work tab for pawns who don't like doing them.
	- BUG FIX: Non-violent pawns will no longer complain about being assigned to
	  hunting unless they actually *are* assigned to hunting.

- 12/03/2017
	- The mod will now work correctly in conjunction with mods such as "Complex
	  Jobs" or "Job Splitter," which subdivide work types.

- 11/13/2017
	- Initial penalties for hated work types are now lower, and the penalties 
	  worsen a bit more slowly than before, though by the 48-hour mark, they'll
	  reach the same maximum as in previous versions of the mod.
	- Added Japanese language translation files by Proxyer.

- 11/12/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld b18 release.

- 09/05/2017
	- Tools which can be used as weapons but which don't buff melee skill are no
	  longer considered weapons when wielded by non-violent pawns. Pacifist pawns
	  can thus now use such tools without penalty, though they can't actually use
	  them as weapons.

- 08/24/2017
	- Non-violent pawns will no longer be considered armed (to determine whether
	  they're capable of violent actions) if they're equipped with an item that
	  isn't actually a weapon.

- 08/05/2017
	- The mod now incorporates "force do job" functionality. Pawns can be given
	  specific tasks, even if they're not actually assigned to the relevant work
	  type, as long as it's not a work type that they hate.

- 07/31/2017
	- Fixed the fix of the fix. Sigh.

- 07/30/2017
	- Fixed the fix so raids will again generate. Sorry about that!

- 07/30/2017
	- Fixed the glitch that was preventing pawns who hate firefighting from
	  putting out fires, even if assigned to do so. This should also take care
	  of any other miscellaneous cases of pawns not doing what they're assigned.
	
- 07/14/2017
	- Added Korean language files, generously provided by Steam user sogo100.

- 07/13/2017
	- This mod is now compatible with Fluffy's "Work Tab" mod.

- 07/11/2017
	- In addition to mood debuffs, hated work assignments now also penalize
	  movement and, eventually, manipulation.
	- The lingering "was assigned to hated work" debuff now lasts a minimum of 
	  one hour. (Otherwise, it still lasts for half as long as the assignment, to
	  a maximum of one day.)
	
- 07/06/2017
	- Initial release of this, Rainbeau's alternate "no traits" version of PAC.

- 06/20/2017
	- Initial RimRue/Rainbeau collaborative update.

- 06/17/2017
	- Initial release of PAC for RimWorld a17 by RimRue, with incapabilities
	  replaced by negative traits.
