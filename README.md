#### Rainbeau Flambe's Pawns are Capable fork

Tired of pawns who refuse to do certain types of work, even when their own lives and the survival of the colony depend on it? This mod changes the way in which the game handles "incapabilities." On the pawns' character tabs, you'll see that the "Incapable of" list has been replaced with a list of "Hated work types." These types of work are marked in amber on the work tab, and aren't assigned by default. But they can be assigned if necessary, as any pawn can be assigned to any type of work. Be aware, though, that if you assign a pawn to do hated work, there's a mood penalty (and eventually movement and even manipulation penalties) that will only grow worse the longer the assignment lasts. This mod is intended to allow you to assign pawns to work they hate in emergency situations. It is *not* intended to allow such assignments to be made on a long-term basis.

Note 1: Since "violent acts" aren't a specific work type, pawns who abhor violence are capable of violent acts -- combat, etc. -- if and only if they're carrying a weapon. But so long as they're armed, they will suffer mood debuffs just as if they were assigned to a work type they hate.

Note 2: As there are easy ways to "get around" restrictions on tasks like hauling, anyway, "incapable of dumb labor" is treated a bit differently than other incapabilities. Pawns who hate dumb labor are simply given an extra trait that reduces their carrying capacity and their unskilled labor work speed. They won't be assigned to hauling or cleaning by default, but can be assigned to those tasks indefinitely with only a minor mood penalty, which doesn't get worse over time. For similar reasons, pawns who hate plant work or skilled labor can still be assigned to plant cutting with only a minor static mood penalty.

It just works! Multiplayer ready and flexible. You can add your own limits for your modded workType with just xml. There is a whitelist for weapons in the xml config as well for you modpack makers.

Note 3: Conceptually the mod works the same as its predecessor, this is a different implementation and some things are different from the original mod.

Note 4: Anger builds up, the longer a pawn is assigned or forced to do something they don't want, the more anger they get. If you stop bothering them, their anger will decay and eventally disappear. If you keep forcing them they'll reach a point where they explode and submit to your requests... if you or they survived, they'll just be lazy for a while but not so angry. Until they get fed up from you again.

Note 5: If you force a pawn to do a job, it will incurr in a penalty, the more you force them, the more they'll anger. There are checks in place to prevent you from gaming the system so be careful of abusing your newly found powers.
